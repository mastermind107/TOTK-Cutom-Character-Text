# TOTK-Cutom-Character-Text

Basically this mod changes the in game dialog from Link to Linkette, for use with the Linkette mod currently being developed by TheRicoLicious on GameBanana. 

The Linkette Name Change Test will be the earliest version of this mod, and can be used in the future for any male character replacement mods. The Linkette Name and Pronoun Change Test version will be used for any future mods that require a change to female pronouns such as the linkle mod when it is released.

It should be noted that this mod is a work in progress and has not been well tested. Use at your own risk. Make sure to have a backup of the original files just in case, as it is very likely that this mod will break some in game dialogue or potentially cause crashes or maybe even save corruption. 

The goal is to eventually also change the in-game pronouns to match the character mods along with creating versions for other characters such as Linkle when that is released. 

This mod was created using this (https://gamebanana.com/tuts/16090) tutorial as a guide.

If you find an error in the in game text that needs to be corrected or find any instances of the wrong name or pronoun used for that particular version of the mod please send a screenshot or a word for word transcript of the text to make it easier to find and fix.
